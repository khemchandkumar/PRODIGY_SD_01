# 🌡️ Temperature Conversion Program  

This project is part of my internship with **Prodigy InfoTech**.  
I developed a GUI-based Temperature Conversion Program using **Python (Tkinter)**.  
The application allows users to input a temperature value in **Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin**, and automatically displays the equivalent values in the other units.

## ✨ Features
- Interactive **GUI** built with Tkinter  
- Supports **Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit ↔ Kelvin** conversions  
- Real-time conversion: entering a value instantly displays results in other units  
- Clean and user-friendly interface
